S4: Simple quasi 1D model for Structural health monitoring of Single lap joint Software
by F. Nicassio and P. Vergallo

Installation
The present program does not need an installation, but Matlab is required. 
The user can simply download the file S4.zip and unzip it. The running code is in S4.m.

Input
After running the procedure in S4.m, four different windows appear to insert 
(i) adherends (Figure 5b,[1]) and (ii) adhesive (Figure 5c, in [1]) properties, 
(iii) geometry features (Figure 5d, in [1]) and (iv) signal characteristics (Figure 5e, in [1]).

Output
After Please wait...Processing your data bar, the animated motion of the signal for the three domains (left adherend, glue layer and right adherend in top, middle and bottom plot in Figure 6 [1], respectively) is provided, in order to check the destructive interference phenomenon in real time (Figure 6, in [1]). A further interactive spectrogram window allows the user to check, evaluate and insert the ‘‘Hole Time’’, information needed to create the final output window.
Finally, transient exciting and acquired signals and relative acquired spectrograms for S4 simulations are reported, one per each chosen debonding value. Each spectrogram represents the time evolution of the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) applied to the transient signals picked up at the receiving sensor location. Each spectrogram is associated to a subplot representing the PSD (Probability Spectral Density) of the signals, obtained by selecting a particular STFT at an instant of time.
